        <h2>Tradition</h2>
        Brigham Young University (BYU) football has a legacy steeped in both athletic excellence and its unique cultural and religious values. Founded in 1922, the Cougars football program has grown into a respected and competitive force in college football, known for its dynamic playing style and commitment to academic and spiritual principles. The team plays its home games at LaVell Edwards Stadium in Provo, Utah—a stadium named after the legendary coach who shaped the program into a powerhouse.<br>

        <h2>Eras</h2>
        The history of BYU football is divided into several key eras, each characterized by its unique contributions and challenges. One of the most pivotal periods was under the leadership of coach LaVell Edwards from 1972 to 2000. Edwards introduced a revolutionary passing offense, establishing BYU as a leader in offensive innovation. His era culminated in a national championship in 1984, led by quarterback Robbie Bosco. This victory placed BYU on the national map and solidified its reputation for producing top quarterbacks who excel both on and off the field.<br>

        <h2>Quarterback Legacy</h2>
        The quarterback tradition at BYU is legendary, featuring players like Steve Young, Jim McMahon, Ty Detmer, and Zach Wilson. These athletes have not only excelled in college but also gone on to achieve success in the NFL. Ty Detmer, in particular, brought national recognition to the program by winning the Heisman Trophy in 1990—an unprecedented honor for BYU. This tradition underscores the program's commitment to developing elite talent, which is a cornerstone of the BYU football philosophy.<br>

        <h2>Holistic Approach</h2>
        BYU football places a strong emphasis on a holistic development approach, reflecting the values of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which sponsors the university. Athletes are required to adhere to the BYU Honor Code, which includes guidelines on dress, grooming, and personal conduct. Many players also take a two-year hiatus from football to serve church missions, returning to the field older and more experienced. This approach not only develops strong character but also fosters resilience and adaptability in players.<br>

        <h2>Western Athletic Conference (WAC)</h2>
        During its time in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), BYU established itself as a dominant force, winning numerous conference championships and bowl games. The Cougars’ competitive edge was demonstrated in their matchups against some of the nation's top teams. The transition to the Mountain West Conference (MWC) in 1999 allowed BYU to continue this legacy of success, with conference championships and a series of notable bowl appearances. Since 2011, as an independent team, BYU has faced a broader array of opponents, showcasing its resilience and ability to compete at the highest level.<br>

        <h2>Entering the Big 12</h2>
        In 2023, BYU made a significant leap by joining the Big 12 Conference. This move marked a new era for the program, offering greater visibility and opportunities to compete against some of college football's best teams. The Cougars’ entry into the Big 12 was a strategic decision that not only increased the program's exposure but also provided access to better recruiting pipelines and greater visibility on a national stage. As they face new challenges in the Power Five conference, BYU remains committed to its values and tradition, seeking to build on its legacy of success.<br>
